      <h2>About the location</h2>
      <p>
        On the Mornington Peninsula (one hour from Melbourne) next door to Portsea.
        Our apartment is a lazy 10-minute walk from the relaxed township of Sorrento that offers restaurants, cafes, a
        chemist, a supermarket, a butcher and lots more. It is located in a quiet avenue, just 4 houses from the beach.
        It is in easy walking distance of the ocean beaches and surf.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your private luxury apartment consists of a spacious living area with leather lounge suite overlooking a sun
        drenched, tree-filled private garden.
        A separate kitchenette has everything you need to make your stay relaxed and comfortable. A queen sized bedroom
        and an amazing bathroom complete with free standing black bath entices you to relax and unwind.
      </p>
      <p>
        Two TVs are sure to make everyone happy! An undercover BBQ area with seating offers plenty of space to stretch
        out and enjoy that cup of freshly brewed coffee or a glass of wine.
      </p>

        This is the perfect place for a home away from home.
